## Opening remarks [(Kunal's](https://twitter.com/kunalstwt) message)

The event started with a warm welcome message from Kunal, the founder of WeMakeDevs, expressing his excitement and gratitude towards the attendees and the speakers. Kunal shared that the vision behind WeMakeDevs is to inspire, educate, and empower individuals who aspire to build a career in the tech industry. He emphasized the need for guidance and the misconceptions surrounding the industry, such as putting all your eggs in one basket and considering failure if you don't make it to a certain company. Kunal pointed out that working in the tech industry is an excellent career choice with endless possibilities. It offers flexibility, freedom, and the opportunity to impact people's lives while doing something you're passionate about. The entry barrier in technology is low, and with the abundance of resources available online, anyone can learn and succeed in this field. However, the challenge lies in finding the right resources and factual information, which is where WeMakeDevs comes in. WeMakeDevs aims to connect like-minded individuals and communities, inspire and educate through tutorials, boot camps, and courses, and empower individuals to shine in their careers. All their events, hackathons, and initiatives are free and aimed at providing valuable resources to the community. Kunal encouraged everyone to check out the mentorship portal, which has all the roadmaps, job resources, and learning materials to get started in a tech stack. He also emphasized the need for active participation in the community and to share the website with friends. WeMakeDevs is a new initiative with big plans for the future, including more meetups across different cities and globally.

## "Head-to-Head: DevOps vs. MLOps: Unraveling the Confusion" by [Subhasmita Swain](https://twitter.com/iam_subhasmita)

Subhasmita Swain, who works as an SRE at CIVO, delivered a captivating session on DevOps versus MLOps. She started by explaining what DevOps is and why it is preferred over traditional software development life cycles. Subhasmita shed light on the never-ending DevOps cycle and how it continuously helps in achieving better software development.

Subhasmita talked about MLOps and clarified that it's not just machine learning plus DevOps plus operations. She stressed the differences between DevOps and MLOps and explained that the soul is the same but the skeleton is different. Subhasmita shared some basics about the ML lifecycle and even surprised the audience by revealing that almost the entire ML pipeline can be automated.

During the session, Subhasmita also presented a quiz question, which intrigued the audience. She asked which company uses DevOps and which one uses MLOps between Netflix and Airbnb. Surprisingly, Netflix uses DevOps, while Airbnb uses MLOps. Subhasmita provided reasons for the same, which made the session even more interesting. The reason behind this is that Netflix is primarily focused on content streaming, which involves managing a massive infrastructure of servers to serve content to millions of users. Therefore, they use DevOps to optimize their infrastructure and streamline their software development process. On the other hand, Airbnb's business model relies heavily on machine learning, as they use it to improve their search engine and personalize recommendations for their users. Therefore, they use MLOps to manage the machine learning lifecycle and ensure that their models are trained, deployed, and monitored efficiently.

Subhasmita concluded her session by sharing some useful resources for MLOps enthusiasts. She gave a link to the attendees to explore more about MLOps, which wasÂ [https://qrfy.com/p/gsOg\_KD3C4?utm\_source=qrcode&utm\_medium=link-list&utm\_campaign=23766943](https://qrfy.com/p/gsOg_KD3C4?utm_source=qrcode&utm_medium=link-list&utm_campaign=23766943).

## **"GitOps: Just a Buzzword" by** [**Abhinav Dubey**](https://twitter.com/abhinavd26)

Abhinav Dubey, a DevOps engineer at Devtron and a CNCF ambassador, gave a talk on "GitOps just a Buzzword" at the WeMakeDevs Delhi meetup. He started by explaining what GitOps is and why it has become popular among developers. According to him, GitOps is an operating model that enables continuous delivery through the use of Git as a single source of truth.

Abhinav also explained the differences between GitOps and traditional DevOps, highlighting how GitOps provides better version control, auditability, and security. He then went on to talk about the various GitOps tools available in the market, including ArgoCD, Flux, and Jenkins X.

One interesting aspect of his talk was the security features that come naively with GitOps. He explained how GitOps provides better security by reducing the need for manual intervention in the deployment process, thus minimizing the risk of human error.

Abhinav also gave a demo of GitOps using a Devtron instance, showcasing how it can be used to manage Kubernetes clusters and automate application deployments. His talk was insightful and informative, leaving the audience with a better understanding of the benefits of using GitOps in their development processes.
